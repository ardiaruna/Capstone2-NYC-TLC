## **Introduction**
---
### **Background**
The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) created in 1971, is the city agency responsible for regulating and licensing the for-hire transportation industry. This includes yellow taxis, green taxis (borough cabs), for-hire vehicles (like Uber and Lyft), commuter vans, and limousines. The TLC’s mission is to ensure that both passengers and drivers have access to safe, reliable, and accessible transportation while promoting sustainability and compliance with city laws. 

The NYC TLC consists of eight divisions, which is: Enforcement, Finance and Administration, IT(Information Technology), Legal Affairs, Licensing and Standards, Policy and External Affairs, Communication, and Safety and Emmisions. Together, these divisions form a comprehensive regulatory body that maintains the balance between innovation and tradition within NYC’s vast for-hire vehicle industry, ensuring that drivers, passengers, and businesses operate in a safe, fair, and efficient environment.

The Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) regulates the licensing of these vehicles to ensure safe and efficient transportation options for residents and visitors. However, the demand for taxi services varies significantly across different neighborhoods and times of day. In many areas, discrepancies exist between the number of licensed cabs and actual passenger demand, leading to inefficiencies such as long wait times for passengers and excessive downtime for drivers. This misalignment affects the overall quality of service provided to passengers, undermining the potential of the taxi system to meet the transportation needs of the community effectively.

### **Problem Question**
How can we pinpoint the pickup locations and the specific times in NYC where passenger demand peaks, to determine where more licensed cabs may be required and reduce the wait time for passenger?

### **Goals**
- **Identify Peak Passenger Location:** <br>
Determine which pick upboroughs and zones with the peak demands

- **Identify Peak Passenger by Time:** <br>
Determine which season, month, day, hour of day with the peak demands

- **Identify Peak Passenger Demand by Location and Time** <br>
Determine which location and in what time does passenger demand peaks.

- **Identify The Wait Time for Trip** <br>
Understand if high-demand areas also have longer or shorter trip durations, impacting driver availability and wait times.
